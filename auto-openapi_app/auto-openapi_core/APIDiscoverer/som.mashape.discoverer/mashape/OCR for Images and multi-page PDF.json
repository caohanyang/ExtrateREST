{"swagger":"2.0","info":{"title":"OCR for Images and multi-page PDF","description":"The free OCR API provides you with a simple way of parsing images and getting text results in JSON. The API can be used from any internet-connected device (desktop, mobile, iPhone, Android, Windows phone, refrigerator...). The API allows one image or one multi-page PDF document to be parsed at once. \r\n\r\nThe free API key (\"helloworld\") allows for 500 requests/day or 15000 requests/month per IP address. So if you use this key inside a mobile phone app, every user would have 500 requests/day. If you need more requests, this is also free. Just email us for a different API key. We enjoy providing this free OCR API, but the API comes with no warranty.","contact":{"name":"a9t9","url":"https://ocr.space/OCRAPI"},"version":null,"x-logo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/mashape-production-logos/apis/560323b3e4b02f2220091a52_medium","x-mashape-categories":["Tools","Media"],"x-origin":{"format":"mashape","url":"https://market.mashape.com/a9t9/ocr-for-images-and-multi-page-pdf"}},"host":"a9t9-ocr-v1.p.mashape.com","basePath":"","paths":{"/parse/image":{"post":{"description":"The free OCR API allows one image or one multi-page PDF document to be parsed at once.
