{"swagger":"2.0","info":{"title":"Tweet Sentiment Analysis","description":"The Tweet Sentiment API lets you send small chunks of text - for example Tweets or Facebook Posts - and returns information about whether the sentiment is probably positive, negative or neutral, along with a score indicating how strong that probability is. It does this using natural language processing, breaking the text down into component parts and comparing those parts to a massive database of human-rated historical data.","contact":{"name":"jamiembrown","url":"https://www.tweetsentimentapi.com/"},"version":null,"x-logo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/mashape-production-logos/apis/53aa5bbbe4b0a705fcc32851_medium","x-mashape-categories":["Social","Data"],"x-origin":{"format":"mashape","url":"https://market.mashape.com/jamiembrown/tweet-sentiment-analysis"}},"host":"jamiembrown-tweet-sentiment-analysis.p.mashape.com","basePath":"","paths":{"/api/":{"get":{"description":"Analyses a string of text and returns information about whether the sentiment is probably negative or positive, along with a score to indicate how strong that probability is.","operationId":"tweet-sentiment-api","produces":["application/json"],"parameters":[{"name":"text","in":"query","description":"The text you want to analyse for sentiment, between 1 and 1000 characters in length","required":true}],"responses":{"200":{"description":null,"schema":"#/definitions/Resource"}}}}},"definitions":{"Resource":{"type":"object","properties":{"sentiment":{"type":"string"},"score":{"type":"integer"}}}}}
