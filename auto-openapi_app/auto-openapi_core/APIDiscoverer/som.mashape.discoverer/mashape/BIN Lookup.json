{"swagger":"2.0","info":{"title":"BIN Lookup","description":"Perform a BIN (Bank Identification Number) or IIN (Issuer Identification Number) lookup.\r\nThis API is ideal for fraud protection systems and payment analysis.\r\nOur BIN database is comprehensive and covers all countries, we update it on a regular basis as new cards are issued.\r\nThis API also includes some extra fraud detection measures if a customer IP address is passed in. In this mode the API will also perform IP geolocation and IP blocklist lookups.\r\nPlease Note: processing and transmitting BIN numbers is perfectly safe as long as no other card information is present, BIN numbers on there own pose no security risk to the card holder or merchant.\r\nTo prevent abuse this API is restricted to a maximum of 5 API calls per day for Free API accounts.","contact":{"name":"neutrinoapi","url":"https://www.neutrinoapi.com/api/bin-lookup/"},"version":null,"x-logo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/mashape-production-logos/apis/53aa5824e4b008bb2ef86c06_medium","x-mashape-categories":["commerce"],"x-origin":{"format":"mashape","url":"https://market.mashape.com/neutrinoapi/bin-lookup"}},"host":"neutrinoapi-bin-lookup.p.mashape.com","basePath":"","paths":{"/bin-lookup":{"post":{"description":"","operationId":"bin-lookup","consumes":["application/json"],"produces":["application/json"],"responses":{"200":{"description":null,"schema":"#/definitions/Resource"}}}}},"definitions":{"Resource":{"type":"object","properties":{"valid":{"type":"string"},"issuer":{"type":"string"},"card-type":{"type":"string"},"issuer-website":{"type":"string"},"card-category":{"type":"string"},"issuer-phone":{"type":"string"},"country-code":{"type":"string"},"card-brand":{"type":"string"},"country":{"type":"string"}}}}}
