{"swagger":"2.0","info":{"title":"NLP dependency parser","description":"Dependency parsing is a well-known problem in Natural Language Processing of taking sentences and determining which parts depend on others, and in what way. Input sentences are parsed into dependency graphs representing dependency between different words in the sentence. The resulting dependency graph is returned in JSON format where dependency arcs are specified by \"depends-on\" and \"relation\" attributes. \r\nPart-of-speech tagging is a task of splitting sentence into words and labeling the words with their corresponding part of speech tag.  API will return each word/tag pair in a separate line.","contact":{"name":"snegirigens","url":"http://ec2-52-24-141-80.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com"},"version":null,"x-logo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/mashape-production-logos/apis/56de0ab7e4b0e1ef6fbaa53a_medium","x-mashape-categories":["Tools","Data"],"x-origin":{"format":"mashape","url":"https://market.mashape.com/snegirigens/nlp-dependency-parser"}},"host":"snegirigens-dependency-parser-v1.p.mashape.com","basePath":"","paths":{"/parse":{"get":{"description":"Syntactic dependency parser for English language sentences","operationId":"parse","parameters":[{"name":"query","in":"query","description":"The sentence to parse","required":true}]}},"/pos":{"get":{"description":"Part of speech tagging for English language","operationId":"pos","parameters":[{"name":"query","in":"query","description":"Sentence to tag"}]}},"/sentiment":{"get":{"description":"Simple sentiment (polarity) analysis.
