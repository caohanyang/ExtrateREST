{"swagger":"2.0","info":{"title":"Animetrics Face Recognition","description":"Powered by Animetrics' patented 2D to 3D facial recognition technology, this API can be used to detect and recognize human faces in pictures.  Detection will return the coordinates of facial features as well as the orientation, or \"pose\" of the face (pitch, roll, and yaw) relative to the camera.  \r\n\r\nIn order to resolve the identity of faces in photographs, you may enroll an unlimited number of faces into a private namespace in our database, and then perform a facial \"recognize\" operation on an unknown face.  Recognize will search your enrolled faces and return likely match candidates. \r\n\r\nA unique capability called “SetPose” is also available, which will create a frontal facial picture from an input photograph of   someone not looking directly at the camera.  I.e. it will produce a \"corrected\" photograph of the person's face,  as if they had been looking directly at the camera when the picture was captured.","contact":{"name":"animetrics","url":"http://api.animetrics.com"},"version":null,"x-logo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/mashape-production-logos/apis/53aa34a5e4b008bb2ef851d9_medium","x-mashape-categories":["Media"],"x-origin":{"format":"mashape","url":"https://market.mashape.com/animetrics/animetrics-face-recognition"}},"host":"animetrics.p.mashape.com","basePath":"","paths":{"/add_to_gallery":{"get":{"description":"Adds an already enrolled Subject into an existing or uncreated Gallery.
