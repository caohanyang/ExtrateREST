{"swagger":"2.0","info":{"title":"RussianSentimentAnalyzer","description":"RussianSentimentAnalyzer is a JSON API based on the technology stack of Insider Solutions company. It is capable of parsing the input text, reconstructing the meaning of messages with typos, like tweets and finding sentiment polarity oriented towards a particular object.\r\n\r\nConsider an example:\r\n\r\nI like new GalaxyS, but do not enjoy new iPhone.\r\n\r\nIf there are no objects, the sentiment of this sentence can be detected as NEUTRAL or MIXED. If, however, GalaxyS has been passed in as an object, the sentiment will be POSITIVE. It will be NEGATIVE for iPhone in this particular example.\r\n\r\nCurrently the API supports Russian language with input texts varying from long formal news posts to informal and short tweets.\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking for text analytics APIs?
