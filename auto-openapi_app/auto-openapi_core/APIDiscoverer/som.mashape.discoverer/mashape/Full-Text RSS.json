By default Full-Text RSS tries to guess whether the response is a feed or regular HTML page. It's a good idea to be explicit by passing the appropriate type in this parameter. This is useful if, for example, a feed stops working and begins to return HTML or redirecs to a HTML page as a result of site changes. In such a scenario, if you've been explicit about the URL being a feed, Full-Text RSS will not parse HTML returned in response. If you pass accept=html (previously html=1), Full-Text RSS will not attempt to parse the response as a feed. This increases performance slightly and should be used if you know that the URL is not a feed.  Note: If excluded, or set to auto, Full-Text RSS first tries to parse the server's response as a feed, and only if it fails to parse as a feed will it revert to HTML parsing. In the default parse-as-feed-first mode, Full-Text RSS will identify itself as PHP first and only if a valid feed is returned will it identify itself as a browser in subsequent requests to fetch the feed items. In parse-as-html mode, Full-Text RSS will identify itself as a browser from the very first request."},{"name":"content","in":"query","description":"If set to 0, the extracted content will not be included in the output."},{"name":"format","in":"query","description":"The default output is RSS. The only other valid output format is JSON. To get JSON output, pass format=json in the querystring. Exclude it from the URL (or set it to ‘rss’) if you’d like RSS."},{"name":"lang","in":"query","description":"Language detection. If you'd like Full-Text RSS to find the language of the articles it processes, you can use one of the following values:  0 - Ignore language; 1 - Use article metadata (e.g. HTML lang attribute) or feed metadata (default value); 2 - As above, but guess the language if it's not specified; 3 - Always guess the language, whether it's specified or not. If language detection is enabled and a match is found, the language code will be returned in the <dc:language> element inside the <item> element."},{"name":"links","in":"query","description":"Links can either be preserved (default), made into footnotes, or removed.

HTML5-PHP is an HTML5 parser implemented in PHP. It's slower than libxml, but can often produce better results. Site-specific rules may invoke HTML5-PHP parsing to ensure all URLs for the site get parsed with it. Use this parameter to explicitly request HTML5-PHP or libxml parsing."},{"name":"summary","in":"query","description":"If set to 1, an excerpt will be included for each item in the output."},{"name":"url","in":"query","description":"URL to a partial feed or a standard HTML page.

We have not enabled this by default because we assume the majority of our users do not display the HTML retrieved by Full-Text RSS in a web page without further processing. If you subscribe to our generated feeds in your news reader application, it should, if it's good software, already filter the resulting HTML for XSS attacks, making it redundant for Full-Text RSS do the same. Similarly with frameworks/CMSs which display feed content - the content should be treated like any other user-submitted content.  If you are writing an application yourself which is processing feeds generated by Full-Text RSS, you can either filter the HTML yourself to remove potential XSS attacks or enable this option. This might be useful if you are processing our generated feeds with JavaScript on the client side - although there's client side xss filtering available too.  Note: if enabled this will also remove certain elements you may want to preserve, such as iframes."}],"responses":{"200":{"description":null,"schema":"#/definitions/Resource"}}}},"/extract.php":{"post":{"description":"Extract article from a web page.
