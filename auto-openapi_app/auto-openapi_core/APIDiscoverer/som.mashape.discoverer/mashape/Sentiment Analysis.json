Additionally, Sentiment Analysis detects if the text processed is subjective or objective and if it contains irony marks [beta], both at global and sentence level, giving the user additional information about the reliability of the polarity obtained from the sentiment analysis.","contact":{"name":"MeaningCloud","url":"http://www.meaningcloud.com"},"version":null,"x-logo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/mashape-production-logos/apis/53aa56e0e4b0a705fcc31c9b_medium","x-mashape-categories":["Data"],"x-origin":{"format":"mashape","url":"https://market.mashape.com/meaningcloud/sentiment-analysis"}},"host":"sentiment-analysis.p.mashape.com","basePath":"","paths":{"/sentiment-2.1.php":{"get":{"description":"Sentiment Analysis 2.1","operationId":"sentiment-2-1","produces":["application/json"],"parameters":[{"name":"cont","in":"query","description":"Disambiguation context.
