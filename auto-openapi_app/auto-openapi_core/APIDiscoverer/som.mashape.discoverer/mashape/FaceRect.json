{"swagger":"2.0","info":{"title":"FaceRect","description":"FaceRect is a powerful and free API for face detection. It finds faces (both frontal and profile) on the image specified by URL or uploaded as a file and is able to find multiple faces on a single photo, producing JSON output with a bounding box for each face found. Check out visual demo here: http://apicloud.me/apis/facerect/demo/. Note that additionally FaceRect can find face features for each detected face (eyes, nose and mouth).
