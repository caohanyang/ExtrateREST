{"swagger":"2.0","info":{"title":"ColorTag","description":"ColorTag is a powerful API for color detection. Taking an image file (or URL) as input ColorTag produces a list of text labels and hex RGB values that can be then used as tags for a certain image or item. Check out visual demo here: http://apicloud.me/apis/colortag/demo/. The API can sort tags by relevance (detecting colors of objects on the image, e.g. a dress, a car, etc.) or simply by weight in the image. First mode is perfect for e-commerce applications, allowing to automatically tag items with colors by simply providing a photo or a thumbnail and build a color tag cloud, so users are able to search items by color (e.g. red). Weight sorting mode can be useful for photos, wallpapers or other images without well-defined objects on them to analyze the palette in general. Text color labels can be assigned with different precision (just basic colors, W3C-compatible colors, precise colors, etc.).","contact":{"name":"apicloud","url":"http://apicloud.me/apis"},"version":null,"x-logo":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/mashape-production-logos/apis/53aa35a9e4b0a705fcc3074a_medium","x-mashape-categories":["Media"],"x-origin":{"format":"mashape","url":"https://market.mashape.com/apicloud/colortag"}},"host":"apicloud-colortag.p.mashape.com","basePath":"","paths":{"/tag-file.json":{"post":{"description":"Returns a JSON object that contains color tags for the uploaded image (visual demo: http://apicloud.me/apis/colortag/demo/)","operationId":"tag-image-file","consumes":["application/json"],"produces":["application/json"],"responses":{"200":{"description":null,"schema":"#/definitions/Resource"}}}},"/tag-url.json":{"get":{"description":"Returns a JSON object that contains color tags for the image specified by URL (visual demo: http://apicloud.me/apis/colortag/demo/)","operationId":"tag-image-url","produces":["application/json"],"parameters":[{"name":"palette","in":"query","description":"The palette used for color tag generation (optional).
