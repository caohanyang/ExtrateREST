Limits the extractor to getting a certain number of addresses per line. Generally, you will leave this unchanged to find as many addresses per line as necessary. If you set this to 1, for instance, the extractor will find an address starting on a certain line, and then skip any other addresses that start on that line. This option is typically set to 1 along with setting  addr_line_breaks to false if you're extracting from spreadsheet data."},{"name":"aggressive","in":"query","description":"Set to true if you want the extractor to be more aggressive in finding addresses. This can use more lookups, but can sometimes find more addresses. For example, aggressive mode can find addresses in popular cities without a state and ZIP code. If too many false positives are appearing, turn off aggressive mode."},{"name":"html","in":"query","description":"HTML in your input is auto-detected, but you can override auto-detection by setting this parameter to true or false if needed. For example, if you have addresses inside HTML tags, you should set this to false and submit only as much HTML code as necessary.
